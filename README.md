Mac PaperClip Module
====================

If you want a full fledged one for your platform, use this: https://github.com/asweigart/pyperclip

This module is a toy for my practice and works only the system that I had in my hands when I wrote this and contains a fraction of the code from the pyperclip module.


Usage
-----

```
import macpyperclip
text = "text to copy"
macpyperclip.copy(text)
# try pasting the test in editor.
print(macpyperclip.paste())

```
